# Hello
Hello there, I am Steven, a final year CS student and backend engineer.

I prefer not to code in:
* C (the pointers argh) 
<br>or 
* C++ (if you are using compiler settings as strict as my lecturer's is <code>TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS</code> should not be a thing) 

On the other hand, I love Python and its design principles, concise and simple syntax (good readability is important mr C++ developer), acceptable performance (even good if you use PyPy), millions of libraries (just think about Flask's extended libraries) and a fantastic community, plus, no pointers (have I mentioned how much I dislike pointers yet?)

<br>
