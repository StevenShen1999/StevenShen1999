# Hello
Hello there, I am Steven, nice to meet you :)

I prefer not to code in:
* C (the pointers argh) 
<br>or 
* C++ (C++98, C++11 onwards is fine, smart pointers >>>>>> C-style pointers)

On the other hand, I love Python and its design principles, concise and simple syntax (with the exception of packing complex expressions in one line, that should never be the right approach), acceptable performance (even good if you use PyPy), millions of libraries and a fantastic community, plus, no C-style pointers (have I mentioned how much I dislike pointers yet?)
